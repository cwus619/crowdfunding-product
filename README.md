## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JS library
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

After several weeks of overtime and a bout of illness, I at last completed this Frontend Mentor challenge making extensive use of JavaScript to control the page's responsiveness amongst other things. While I feel there were perhaps easier ways using flexbox to control the page's responsiveness, I felt using JS would provide an opportunity to demonstrate my understanding of JS.

One of the new elements I had the chance to use here was the <progress> element for the donation progress bar. When I first decided to confront this challenge, I was unaware of this and thus had to research how to create a progress bar. Similarly, I had issues with amending the colour in line with the specification. Researching further into working with the progress bar and customising it, I learnt about the -webkit-appearance attribute and how to customise the CSS of the -webkit-progress-bar and -webkit-progress-value pseudoclasses.

While this was not a new feature to me, the need to make greater use of JavaScript gave me an opportunity to think about ways of refactoring my code into functions to reduce repetition and thus make my code more concise. While I am sure there are more logical ways of laying out, I am quite happy with how my JS has worked out in its current form, though I will look into further refactoring it where possible.

While I did not make extensive use of jQuery, research into how to handle clicks on the radio form, jQuery came highly recommended. 


### Continued development

I feel increasingly confident with my understanding and use of vanilla JS. Therefore, I intend to improve my understanding of jQuery and ReactJS. I also intend to make further progress with my learning on Udemy to ensure my understanding of MongoDB remains fresh.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - As time went by, I reduced my dependence on Bootstrap, but have retained some use of it. Naturally, the Bootstrap website was the best guide for understanding and using Bootstrap classes.
- [CSS Tricks - HTML5 Progress Element](https://css-tricks.com/html5-progress-element/) - As can be seen from previous projects, I'm a huge fan of CSS Tricks and this guide was no exception to the other guides - this one helped me immensely with understanding how to make use of and customise the progress bar.
