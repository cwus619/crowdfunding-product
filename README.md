# crowdfunding-product
This is my solution to the crowdfunding product page challenge on frontend mentor - currently a WIP, which I'll be uploading in stages.

## Progress
Current version is just the basic layout of the webpage for dekstop. The next steps I'll be working on:
- Creating the modal boxes
    - Modal box for selecting - almost finished
    - Success modal box
    - Ability to close modal box - complete   
- Improving responsiveness
- Creating mobile version
