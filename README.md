# crowdfunding-product
This is my solution to the crowdfunding product page challenge on frontend mentor - currently a WIP, which I'll be uploading in stages.

##Progress
Current version is just the basic layout of the webpage for dekstop. The next steps I'll be working on:
- Creating the modal boxes
- Improving responsiveness
- Creating mobile version
